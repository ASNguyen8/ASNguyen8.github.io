Was it all just a dream or<br>
Was it just the price to pay?<br>
Now I'm left here to pray in silence<br>
And You got what you wanted<br>
<br>
I search for meaning<br>
When all I used to do was dreaming<br>
Disconsolate, mourning a loss<br>
Lonesome at best<br>
Run away<br>
But I can never escape<br>
From the pain in my brain<br>
This fucking misery<br>
<br>
I need a reason for who we are<br>
I need to breath, throughout the war<br>
I lost faith in myself again<br>
<br>
I lost faith in myself again<br>
<br>
Just breath in<br>
Just breath in<br>
And bury me<br>
And bury me<br>
Just pretend<br>
Just pretend<br>
And run away<br>
And run away<br>
<br>
I'm slowly shutting down and<br>
I can't deny, that all I do is losing control<br>
You know I can't keep going on, this shit is taking its toll<br>
But I can never escape<br>
But I can never escape<br>
<br>
But I can never escape<br>
<br>
System failure<br>
<br>
I need a reason for who we are<br>
I need to breath, throughout the war<br>
I lost faith in myself again<br>
<br>
I lost faith in myself again...
