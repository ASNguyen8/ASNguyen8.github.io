    <div>
      You're just a goddamn liar, playing a fucking a role,<br>
      bragging that perfect life you've never had.<br>
      The tables turn, kid.<br>
      I just can't wait to see it.<br>
      I wanna know what you are made of.<br>
      Oh<br>
      <br>
      You just don't know who you are,<br>
      there's not much left of yourself.<br>
      How could you even see with your heart?<br>
      You can not see the whole world around.<br>
      <br>
      There is no chance to..<br>
      ..to cover this hole.<br>
      I can't see where your heart takes place.<br>
      There's nothing clear in this game you play and you're losing yourself.<br>
      Because you're living a lie,<br>
      you don't even know who your friends are.<br>
      Do you feel the gravity?<br>
      Just come back down.<br>
      <br>
      Alternating the reality,<br>
      you heart is blinded by the that lies you told.<br>
      You want a life you'll never have,<br>
      leading yourself to your motherfucking downfall.<br>
      Open your mind to the world around<br>
      or you will never make it out alive.<br>
      <br>
      You just don't know who you are,<br>
      there's not much left of yourself.<br>
      How could you even see with your heart?<br>
      you can not see the whole world around.<br>
      <br>
      There is no chance to..<br>
      ..to cover this hole.<br>
      I can't see where your heart takes place.<br>
      There's nothing clear in this game you play and you're losing yourself.<br>
      Because you're living a lie,<br>
      you don't even know who your friends are.<br>
      Do you feel the gravity?<br>
      Just come back down.<br>
      <br>
      Open your eyes all your loved ones are faking.<br>
      You're getting caught up by your lies,<br>
      I just can't wait to see how this will end.<br>
      Oh, you'll never know how to animate<br>
      your empty heart.<br>
      You'll never feel that fire.<br>
      <br>
      You feel nothing.<br>
      Your chest is empty, you can't fill this space.<br>
      Your heart is gone for good, leaving you loveless.<br>
      It's been a while that you're life is a mindfuck.<br>
      How the fuck could you live with yourself?<br>
      <br>
      You're just a goddamn liar, playing a fucking a role,<br>
      bragging that perfect life you've never had.<br>
      Facing the mirror, you just can't be yourself,<br>
      feeling the reality slip between your fingertips.
