    <h1>Novelists Fr - Heartfelt</h1>
    <br><br>
    <div>
      Those heartfelt feelings that I got<br>
      Are getting a hold of me<br>
      I gotta let them be<br>
      And this is why I need to tell you the things that I feel<br>
      How much it means to me<br>
      How much it counts to me<br>
      <br>
      You were into my heart before it locked itself<br>
      You're all I can save from the shallowness<br>
      You're the key of my soul<br>
      But my soul is lost when love's a door that we fear to leave unlocked<br>
      <br>
      Even the worst we've lived could never change my mind<br>
      You're bringing back the pulse in my veins<br>
      You've seen the the back of my mind<br>
      But now it's hard to mean something<br>
      <br>
      I found this fire burning into your breast<br>
      This love has never been much brighter than what I could guess<br>
      The things we've lacked could have changed us<br>
      For a better version of ourselves<br>
      <br>
      No matter what they can say<br>
      Or the price we might have to pay for this<br>
      They can't change the way that I feel<br>
      The way that I feel when you're away<br>
      <br>
      There is always a way to cross all the miles<br>
      That will pave our fate<br>
      We just can't change<br>
      And the world can stop<br>
      I won't give a fuck<br>
      Cause I've got something that counts<br>
      And I will never let it leave<br>
      <br>
      They spit the venom, I gotta take it out<br>
      Love is a hushed bird you shouldn't cast out<br>
      Well if it's meaning a break, they shouldn't have lied<br>
      Shouldn't have spent a whole night riding a fat ass<br>
      I can't feel a remorse, I can't have time to find why you're that addictive<br>
      'Cause a sad heart cannot fake feelings<br>
      It's not the first time that love is dead living<br>
      <br>
      It makes me sick, cause all of the mistakes we've done<br>
      Were meant to make our path<br>
      Snakes will keep spitting<br>
      But we remain faithful to our beliefs<br>
      <br>
      I'm so tired of these shits, no matter what<br>
      And how many times we've to rebuild on ruins<br>
      A structure that can hold us closely<br>
      <br>
      No matter what they say<br>
      Or the price we might have to pay for this<br>
      They can't change the way I feel, they can't<br>
      Nor your place in my heart when you're next to me<br>
      <br>
      Even the worst we've lived could never change my mind<br>
      You're bringing back the pulse in my veins<br>
      You've seen the back of my mind<br>
      But now it's hard to mean something<br>
      <br>
      I found this fire burning into your breast<br>
      This love has never been much brighter than what I could guess<br>
      The things we've lacked could have changed us<br>
      For a better version of ourselves<br>
      <br>
      The winter has passed<br>
      I was hoping you'd hold on through those nights in the cold<br>
      You don't know how much I'm hollow, how much I miss you<br>
      The summer is coming<br>
      I'm awaiting the day when I can finally take you home<br>
      'Cause this time I'm gonna show you<br>
      How much I love you
