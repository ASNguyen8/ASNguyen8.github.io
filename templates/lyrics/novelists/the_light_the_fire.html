    <h1>Novelists Fr - The Light, The Fire</h1>
    <br><br>
    <div>
      Your eyes tend to remind me so frequently<br>
      The cold and distant light of these heavenly bodies<br>
      I know too well that I'm the only one to blame, I'm sorry<br>
      I knew where we'd be led but I just kept walking<br>
      <br>
      Now, I see the light, the fire devouring the coal<br>
      Now I'm used to singing with the monster I've become<br>
      To dream of the gold in the river<br>
      Oh, the nights have become longer to stand<br>
      And the dawn is harder to wake each day<br>
      <br>
      These nights have stolen the best<br>
      And what is left should never be yours<br>
      I'm fading with the gleam of a far-off firmament<br>
      <br>
      My soul weeps an ocean I can't seem to drain<br>
      I'm drowning in these waters<br>
      Sink as deep as I can sink<br>
      I know too well that I'm the only to blame<br>
      I'm sorry<br>
      I knew where I'd be led<br>
      <br>
      I've spent my whole life<br>
      Dreaming of a brighter light<br>
      But I doubt you can ever realize<br>
      That all these songs to call-off the jinx<br>
      Might be everything this world has left me<br>
      <br>
      Now, I see the light, the fire, devouring the call<br>
      Now I'm used to singing with the monster I've become<br>
      To dream of the gold in the river<br>
      Oh, the nights have become longer to stand<br>
      The dawn is harder to wake each day<br>
      <br>
      I can't seem to live with these dreams of you<br>
      Fuck!
